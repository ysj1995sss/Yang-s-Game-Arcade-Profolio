How to Configure It:
Open the new index.html file in a text editor (like Notepad or VS Code).

Scroll to the very bottom to the <script> section.

Change YOUR_USERNAME_HERE to your actual GitHub username.

Change YOUR_REPO_NAME_HERE to the exact name of your repository (e.g., arcade or games).
Example: 
const GITHUB_USERNAME = "cool-gamer-123";
const REPO_NAME = "my-arcade";

Now, when anyone clicks the **`</>`** button on a game card, they will be taken directly to that file's code in your GitHub repository!



Easy Management:

To Add a Game: Just add a new line to the gamesList.

To Reorder: Just cut and paste the lines in the list.
